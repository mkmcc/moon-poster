moon-poster: makes a pretty lunar phase poster, useful for planning
night hikes

i use the [[http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/][python pyephem]] package to calculate lunar phases, and the
[[http://tioga.rubyforge.org/doc/][tioga]] plotting package to lay out and typeset the poster.

shows lunar phase, full and new moons, and friday and saturday nights.

calculates are done in the local timezone, which is pacific standard
time for me.

below i show an example full poster:
